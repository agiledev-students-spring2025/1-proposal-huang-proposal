# Project Proposal

## Project Title: PetPals

### What and Why？

It is often difficult for pet owners to manage pet care routines, access reliable pet health information, and engage with other pet owners. The classic solution is scattered pet care apps and online forums. But it is time-cosuming when every pet owner has to juggle multiple sources for advice and tracking. However, **PetPals** can perfectly solve this problem.

**PetPals** allows users to streamline pet care routines and foster a community of pet owners to collect all the information they need. During active tracking, users can monitor their pet’s health, access expert advice, and engage with a supportive pet care network. During community interactions, users can share their own experiences and problems, discuss best practices, and learn from veterinarians and other pet enthusiasts.

#### Features:
- Improve pet health tracking and management
- Encourage community-driven pet care support
- Enhance access to expert pet care insights
- Make pet care more engaging and interactive

### For Whom?

This app is for all pet owners, veterinarians, and anyone looking to improve pet care routines through reliable information and social engagement. Additionally, it serves as a valuable resource for pet enthusiasts looking to prepare for welcoming a new pet into their family. 

### How?

**PetPals** will contain components of a health tracking app and a social networking platform. The health tracking portion will include various widgets to optimize pet care efficiency while the social networking platform will offer diverse categories and discussion groups, enabling users to address challenges and share experiences effectively.

#### Key Features:
- **Pet Health Tracker**: Monitor vaccinations, appointments, and dietary plans.
- **Community Space**: Interact, share experiences, and discuss best practices.
- **AI Recommendations**: Get expert insights on pet care and behavioral training.
- **Pet-Friendly Locations**: Discover parks, restaurants, and services catering to pets.
- **Expert-Led Content**: Access videos and articles from veterinarians and trainers.

Users can seamlessly switch between health tracking and social engagement modes in one app based on their needs. The health tracking system enables pet owners to set reminders for vaccinations, access to their pets' medical history, and receive their own AI-powered wellness recommendations tailored to their pet’s specific needs.

Meanwhile, the social networking platform fosters an interactive pet care community where users can seek advice, join interest-based groups, and participate in live Q&A sessions with veterinarians and pet experts. Additionally, an integrated pet-friendly locator helps users discover nearby pet-friendly parks, cafes, and services.

To enhance collaboration, pet owners can share their pet’s health records with veterinarians and caregivers, ensuring better-coordinated care and expert guidance.

### Scope

PetPals can be implemented with a small development team with 4-5 members over a few months because its core functionalities are straightforward. The biggest challenge would be integrating AI-driven recommendations and synchronizing user interactions with external veterinary databases. This project is easily expandable, allowing future features such as real-time vet consultations and smart pet device integration.
